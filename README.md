# Comparative Algorithm Analysis for Ml-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
This repository contains Jupyter Notebook implementations from our research on evaluating and comparing machine learning algorithms for intrusion detection systems (IDS). The analysis is performed using two prominent datasets: **NSL-KDD** and **UNSW-NB15**. Our study examines the performance of six machine learning algorithms—spanning supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning paradigms—to identify the most effective approach for modern cyber threat detection.

## 🌱 Motivation
The landscape of cybersecurity threats is continuously evolving, with new intrusion techniques emerging at a rapid pace. Traditional detection systems struggle to keep up, which makes adaptive and intelligent methods, like machine learning, essential for robust protection. This research aims to assess which algorithms are best suited to the changing threat environment and to offer practical insights for deploying IDS solutions in real-world scenarios.

## 🚀 Getting Started
To run the notebooks and reproduce our analysis:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ml-intrusion-detection-analysis.git
